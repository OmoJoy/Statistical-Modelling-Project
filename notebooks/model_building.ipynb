Notes:
[1] Standard Errors assume that the covariance matrix of the errors is correctly specified.
Interpretation of Results:

R-squared: From the model above, an R-squared value of 0.032 indicates that about 3.2% of the variability in the dependent variable (Average Rating) is explained by the variability in the independent variable (Number of Bikes). Thus, this model does not explain a significant amount og variation in the dependent variable.

P-value: In this model output, the P-values for both the const coefficient and the Number of Bikes coefficient are very small (close to zero). This indicates that they are both statistically significant predictors of the dependent variable, Average Rating.

Coefficient: For this linear regression model, the coefficient for Number of Bikes is approximately 0.0019, suggestitng that on average, a one unit increase in the Number of Bikes correlates with an increase of 0.0019 in the Average Rating.

Conclusion: While we can establish a statistically significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables, it is also worthy to note that the relationship between them is quite weak as evidenced by the low R-squared value.

How can you turn the regression model into a classification model?

To convert the regression model into a classification model, I will first define which attritube I am trying to predict. Next, I'll work on grouping mu continuous variables into discrete labels to help create the class. Then I'll select an appropriate classification algorithm and afterwards, evaluate my model.
